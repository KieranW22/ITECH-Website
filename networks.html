			<h3 id="networkmedia">Network Media</h3>
			<p>
				Computer networks can make use of different types of network media. The two types are:
				<ul>
					<li>Nodes: PC, Server, Switch, Bridge, Router</li>
					<li>Links: Optic fibers, Coaxial cable, Wireless</li>
				</ul>

			<h3 id="protocols">Protocols</h3>
			<p>
				Protocols are a set of rules that allows devices to communicate over a network. Internet protocols include high level protocols like, TCP, UDP, HTTP and FTP as well as lower-level protocols such as ARP and ICMP.

			<h3 id="analogdigitalsignals">Analog &amp; Digital Signals</h3>
			<p>
				Analog signals vary continuously and can have many values inside of a range. Digital signals are pulses of voltage &#40;either 1 or 0&#41;.

			<h3 id="multiplexing">Multiplexing</h3>
			<p>There are three types of directional transmission:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><b>Simplex</b></dt><dd>Only one direction</dd>
				<dt><b>Half-duplex</b></dt><dd>Both directions but only one direction at a time</dd>
				<dt><b>Full-duplex</b></dt><dd>Transmitted in both directions simultaneously</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Multiplexing allows multiple signals to be combined into a single channel and transmitted togther. It is mostly used in telecommunications.</p>

			<h3 id="ethernet">Ethernet</h3>
			<p>
				Ethernet has been hugely popular due to the its simplicity, ease of integration and because it is inexpensive.
				<br><br>
				Switching is used in networks to create connections between multiple devices. There are three types of switching:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><b>Circuit</b></dt><dd>Connection established before transmission. Data follows a dedicated route.</dd>
				<dt><b>Message</b></dt><dd>Connection established then broken after transmission. Information is stroed then forwarded to next device.</dd>
				<dt><b>Packet</b></dt><dd>Used by Ethernet &amp; Internet. Data broken into smaller packets which can take any route to the destination, where the data is reassembled</dd>
			</dl>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h3 id="routing">Routing</h3>
			<p>
				All hosts and interfaces have the same Network ID &#40;prefix&#41; but a unique IP address &#40;suffix&#41;. A router is required to connect to other networks as it acts as the defualt gateway for data to pass between networks.
			</p>
			<p>
				IPv4 uses a 32-bit number represented in dotted decimal to address devices. <em>E.g. 192.168.0.1</em><br>
				IPv6 uses a 128-bit address which is represented in hexadecimal. <em>E.g. 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</em>
			</p>

		<article>
			<h3 id="udptcp">UDP &amp; TCP</h3>
			<p>
				UDP is an unreliable, unordered delivery of packets and provides fragmentation and reassembly, multiplexing and error detection.<br><br>
				TCP is reliable and in-order delivery of packets using all of UDP plus reliable data transfer.
			</p>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h3 id="dnsnat">DNS &amp; NAT</h3>
			<p>
				DNS allows textual web addresses to be mapped to IP addresses. An example of using DNS would be naviagting to <em>www.google.co.uk</em> in your web browser. You are connecting to an IP server address which is hidden behing Google's URL.<br><br>
				NAT enables private IP addresses to connect to public networks. For example, your home network has one public IP address for all your home devices.
